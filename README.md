# FAULT DETECTION OF INDUCTION MOTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING
Fault Detection of Induction Motor Using Machine Learning specifically refers to the application of machine learning techniques for the purpose of detecting faults in induction motors
1. **Machine Learning Application**: Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze data collected from induction motors. This data typically includes sensor readings such as vibration patterns, temperature variations, current and voltage levels, and other operational parameters.

2. **Fault Detection**: The primary objective is to train machine learning models using historical data that includes instances of known faults (such as broken rotor faults, bearing faults, winding faults) and normal operation. These models learn patterns and anomalies from the data to detect deviations that may indicate the presence of a fault.

3. **Automated Detection**: Machine learning enables automated and continuous monitoring of induction motors. By integrating predictive models into monitoring systems, early signs of faults can be identified before they escalate into significant issues, thereby minimizing downtime and maintenance costs.

4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Using machine learning for fault detection enhances the reliability and efficiency of maintenance processes. It allows for proactive maintenance scheduling based on real-time insights, improving overall operational efficiency and reducing the risk of unexpected failures.

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting faults in an induction motor using machine learning techniques. Three types of faults were identified and analyzed:

1. **Broken Rotor Fault**: 
   - **Description**: This fault occurs when there is physical damage or breakage in the rotor structure of the induction motor.
   - **Impact**: It can cause irregularities in motor rotation, increased vibrations, and potentially lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed.

2. **Bearing Fault**: 
   - **Description**: Bearing faults in induction motors are often due to wear, lack of lubrication, or contamination.
   - **Impact**: These faults can result in abnormal noise during operation, increased friction, overheating, and reduced motor efficiency.

3. **Winding Faults**: 
   - **Description**: Winding faults involve issues such as short circuits, open circuits, or insulation breakdown in the motor windings.
   - **Impact**: These faults can lead to irregular motor operation, overheating, increased electrical current consumption, and potential damage to other motor components.
